# Setting Up Auth.js

Auth.js is a library that helps developers add authentication (login, signup, and session handling) to their web apps easily.

Itâ€™s mainly used in Next.js (a React framework), but it can also work with other JavaScript/TypeScript backends.

Instead of writing all the code to manage login, tokens, sessions, and third-party providers (like Google, GitHub, or Facebook logins), Auth.js gives you ready-made tools.

## Installation

Install Auth.js into your project by running the following command:

```Bash
npm install next-auth@beta
```

## Adding Route handlers

Auth.js actually uses route handlers for its authentication endpoints. For example, you set up an `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file, and Auth.js puts all the login/logout/session logic there.

In this file you have to create a handler function by importing and calling NextAuth. We pass a configuration object to NextAuth which we'll come back to.

We then export the handler function with 2 different names i.e. GET and POST. This means any GET and POST request sent to this endpoint will be handled inside the handler function.

```TS
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

const handler = NextAuth({})

export { handler as GET, handler as POST}
```

## Creating .env Variables

Finally, we need to create environment variables for `NEXTAUTH_URL` and set it to the address of our website and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` which has to be a long random string which Auth.js will use to encrypt and sign the authentication keys.

> To generate a long random string you can run the following command in the node terminal: `require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`
