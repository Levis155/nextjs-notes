# Showing Loading UIs

React 18 offers a newly introduced feature called **Suspense** which can be used to show fallback UI while a component is being rendered.

We can see it in action below:

```TSX
import UserTable from "./UserTable";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Suspense } from "react";

interface Props {
  searchParams: { sortOrder: string };
}

const UsersPage = async ({ searchParams: { sortOrder } }: Props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <Link href="/users/new" className="btn">
        New User
      </Link>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <UserTable sortOrder={sortOrder} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
};

export default UsersPage;

```

The UserTable is grabbed inside a suspense component and a fall-back UI is shown `Loading...` while the component is being rendered and data is being fetched.

We can have multiple suspense components or boundaries in a given page but what if we want to put every page inside a suspense boundary such that as we navigate between pages a loading UI is shown. This can be achieved through several ways:

- **/app/layout.tsx:**

```TSX
import "./globals.css";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import Navbar from "./Navbar";
import { Suspense } from "react";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <Navbar />
        <main className="p-5">
          <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}></Suspense>
          {children}
        </main>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

- The other way is by adding a loading file `/app/loading.tsx` inside the app folder:

```TSX
import React from 'react'

const Loading = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Loading...
    </div>
  )
}

export default Loading

```
