# Uploading Files

To store a file that a user uploads in a Next.js application we have to use a cloud platform.
Some popular cloud platforms include
- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Cloudinary

Out of all these Cloudinary has perfect integration with Next.js and this makes it the best choice.
